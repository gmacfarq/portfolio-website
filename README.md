# portfolio-website
My personal website to present and practice my web development skills
## TODO 
- Add JS to display skills when hovering over experience
- (maybe) Use AJAX for contact form instead of post request
- Improve styling with SCSS
- Write DocStrings 
# Installation and Launch
- Clone this repository
- Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`
- Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Execute `flask run`
- Note: email/contact form will not function correctly without .env
